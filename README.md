# Python Data Analysis Assignment by Marc Wilson Flores from 2ECE-C
## Problems 
Two problems were presented in this assignment and a .csv file. In the first part, I was tasked to upload the .csv file and use the list in the file to display the first and last 5 items in the list.

After that, the next problem tasked me to manipulate the code to find specific data from the list

## Background
There was no real challenge for the first problem, as I remembered most of the code I needed to upload the .csv file and display the first and last 5 items on the list.

For the second problem, however, there were some complications as the problem required the output of specific data only. After consulting my notes, I have successfully coded the program to what was asked from the question until 2-d. I was confused as I couldn't output the cyl and gears only with the multiple car models being found. I searched the internet and finally fixed it by using the .isin function.

## Outputs
Here are the outputs I achieved for each problem:
